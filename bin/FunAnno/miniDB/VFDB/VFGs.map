VFG000676	VF0142	Anthrax toxin	-	Bacillus anthracis	AtxA, a pXO1 gene required for transcription of the three toxin genes, also positively regulated encapsulation; the expression of atxA gene is not controlled by CO2	Belongs to the family of bacterial AB toxins:;  composed of a single B subunit called protective antigen (PA) and two alternative A subunits: edema factor (EF) and lethal factor (LF); Monomeric PA displays four structural domains:;  Domain 1 contains the proteolytic activation site. Domain 2 is a <beta>-barrel core containing a large flexible loop for pore formation. Domain 3 is involved in heptamer formation. Domain 4 binds to anthrax toxin receptor (ATR); LF is organized into four domains:;  Domain 1 (LFn) is the PA-binding domain. Domain 2 (VIP2-like, VIP2, an ADP-ribosylating toxin from Bacillus cereus) participates in forming a binding pocket for substrate peptide. Domain 3 is a helical bundle that may contribute to substrate specificity by restricting access to the binding pocket. Domain 4 is the catalytic center;  PDB code for PA: 1ACC, LF: 1J7N, EF: 1K8T, 1K93, 1K90	The combination of PA and EF is edema toxin (EdTx), the combination of PA and LF is lethal toxin (LeTx); EF is a calcium- and calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase that causes dramatic increases in intracellular concentrations of cAMP; LF is a zinc-dependent protease that cleaves mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MAPKKs) in their amino-terminal regions. It is a multi-functional virulence factor that appears to play a role in all stages of infection. Early in the infection, it acts to suppress immune cell and cytokine responses, thereby promoting bacterial outgrowth. Later in the disease, it induces the cytokine-independent shock-like death associated with anthrax.	PA, EF and LF are secreted independently and assemble at the mammalian cell surface into toxin complexes. PA binds to cell-surface anthrax toxin receptor (ATR), encoded by the tumor endothelial marker 8 (TEM8) gene. ATR is a type I membrane protein with an extracelluar von Willebrand factor type A domain (VWA) and is cleaved by furin or a furin-like protease, releases a amino-terminal 20kDa fragment (PA20) and the receptor-bound carboxy-terminal 63kDa fragment (PA63). Recently, a second PA receptor encoded by capillary morphogenesis gene 2 (CMG2) has been identified. It has 60% amino acid identity to ATR/TEM8 within the VWA/I domain, as well as a conserved MIDAS (metal ion dependent adhesion site) motif; PA63 oligomerizes into ring-shaped hepameric or actameric pre-channels and binds 3 or 4 LF/EF substrates respectively. The assembled toxic complexes are then internalized by membrane lipid rafts and directed to endosomes. The PA oligomer transforms into a transmembrane, <beta>-barrel channel. The proton motive force unfolds and translocates LF and EF through the channel. Once the enzymatic moieties have accessed the cytosolic compartment, they exert their toxic activites.

Brucella initiates interactions with Sar1/COPII-dependent ERES (ER exit sites), the early secretory pathway. Unlike Legionella, that intercepts COPI-dependent vesicular trafficking from the ER for the biogenesis of its ER-derived replicative organelle; The acidified Brucellacontaining vacuole (BCV) interacts with late endosome/lysosomes, acquiring markers such as LAMP-1, CD63 and Rab7. Subsequently, wild-type Brucella is able to exclude these late endosomal/lysosomal markers from its vacuole and acquire markers of the endoplasmic reticulum. The replicative organelle contains not only the ER marker calreticulin, but also two proteins, Rab2 and GAPDH, that regulate membrane traffic between the ER and Vesicular Tubular Compartments (VTC), a compartment in the secretory pathway between ER and Golgi in which proteins are sorted either to an anterograde pathway to the Golgi, or for recycling to the ER.

When a critical cell population density has been attained, quorum-sensing molecules bind to the receptor protein LuxR, then induces or represses target genes involved in diverse functions. LuxR was shown to tightly control expression of luxI, likely through binding to a lux box-like sequence that partially overlaps the -35 region of the putative luxI.	Signaling; Intercellular signaling

Soluble monomers of PFO bind to cholesterol-rich lipid membranes through hydrophobic loops at the tip of domain 4. Next, PFO monomers oligomerize on the membrane, ultimately forming pre-pore rings. Then, domain 3 <alpha>-helices pass through a disordered state and rearrange to form 2 <beta>-hairpins per monomer.

Because of their sequence homology, similar domain structure and glycosyltransferase properties these toxins are designated 'large clostridial cytotoxins'.	The catalytic domain and the receptor binding domain are located at the N-terminus and C-terminus, respectively. The hydrophobic region in the middle part of the toxin molecule is proposed to be involved in translocation of the proteins across cellular membranes.;The C-terminal receptor-binding domain, is characterized by small repetitive sequence motifs, also called CROPS, clostridial repetitive oligopeptides. They consist of 20 to 50 amino acids and are repeated 14-30 times. The whole repetitive region of toxin A is needed for binding and endocytosis.; PDB code: 2G7C	Transfer the glucose moiety from UDP-glucose to members of the Rho family of small GTPase	"It is suggested that a carbohydrate structure (containing at least Gal<beta>1-4GlcN) is the essential element for binding of toxin A to its cell receptor, whether this carbohydrate is linked to proteins or lipids is unknown.;TcdA and TcdB modify Rho A, B, and C at threonine-37 and Rac, Cdc42, or Ras at the corresponding position threonine-35. Rho is preferentially modified in its inactive, GDP-bound state, in which threonine-37 is directed toward the solvent. In the GTP-bound state, threonine-37 participates in Mg2+ and nucleotide binding and appears to be less accessible for glucosylating clostridial toxins.; Toxin-induced glucosylation of Rho/Ras proteins causes dramatic morphological changes in eukaryotic cells. A dramatic redistribution of the actin cytoskeleton takes place.; Toxin-induced fluid response and diarrhea may be explained by tissue damage and inhibition of the barrier function of the enterocytes. They decrease transepithelial resistance, increase paracellular bacterial migration, and change the morphological features of tight junctions and associated proteins.; Both toxin A and toxin B have an

Their substrate specificities resemble that of lethal toxin. C. difficile strain C34 produces a toxin B variant modifying Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 as well as R-Ras, Ral, and Rap.	Toxin B includes three functional domains. ; I: The receptor-binding domain is composed of repetitive oligopeptide elements commonly accepted as the motif for binding to carbohydrate structures of the receptor. ; II: A hydrophobic region in the middle part of the molecule is supposed to form a transmembrane domain, allowing the catalytic domain to translocate into the cytoplasm. ; III: The catalytic domain residing in the N terminal part possesses monoglucosyltransferase activity to modify the Rho-GTPases.;The first 546 residues of the N-terminus are the minimum size. The tryptophan-102 (W) and the DXD motif (residues 286-288) are involved in UDP-glucose cosubstrate binding through Mn2+ or Mg2+.The C-terminal part (residues 408-468) of the catalytic domain covers the protein substrate recognition site.; TcdB exhibits a higher rate of enzymatic activity than TcdA, leading to a quickened rate of cytopathic effects in some cell types.; PDB code: 2BVL, 2BVM	Transfer the glucose moiety from UDP-glucose to members of the Rho family of small GTPase	On binding to host cell receptors (The receptor for TcdB is undefined), the toxins are endocytosed. The low pH in endosomes triggers the first conformational change of the toxin leading to pore formation of the ligand translocation domain. Cytosolic inositolphosphates InsPx interacts with TcdB and induces second conformational change, activating the intrinsic protease function. The catalytic-DXD domain is released into cytosol. This is the first report on a bacterial toxin that uses eukaryotic signals for induced autoproteolysis to deliver its toxic domain into the cytosol of target cells.

VFG002289	VF0374	TeNT	Tetanus neurotoxin	Clostridium tetani	BoNTs and TeNT share ~35% sequence identity. The BoNT catalytic LC domains share up to 36% sequence identity, and the LC domains of BoNT/B and TeNT have over 50% identity.	TeNT is also structurally organized into heavy and light chains linked by a disulphide bond. The N-terminal L chain contains zinc endopeptidase activity, the HN domain of H chain is involved in escape of the toxin from endocytotic vesicles, and the HC domain of H chain is involved in binding to cellular receptors.;Structural analysis of HC, also termed fragment C, complexed with synthetic ganglioside reveals two distinct ganglioside binding sites on HC, termed the 'Gal4-GalNAc3', and 'sialic acid' binding sites.;  PDB code:1YVG,1AF9,1D0H	TeNT is a neurospecific toxin that binds to motor neurons at the neuromuscular junction, where it is internalized and undergoes axonal retrograde transport to the cell body. It is then secreted and taken up by adjacent inhibitory interneurons, where it blocks neurotransmitter release by cleaving VAMP/synaptobrevin.	The TeNT receptor complex has been shown to comprise ganglioside of G1b series and a protein receptor: synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 (SV2A, SV2B). The binding takes place within selected regions of the plasmamembrane that are enriched in cholesterol, gangliosides and glycophosphoinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins.; The action of BoNTs is mainly restricted to the neuromuscular junction, where they cause a long-lasting blockade of acetylcholine release. Unlike BoNTs, once internalized, TeNT undergoes retrograde axonal transport to the central nervous system, transcytosing across the synapse to internalize into the interneurons that regulate motorneuron activity. The spastic paralysis that results from intoxication with TeNT arises from the loss of spinal inhibitory control of motorneuron activity.; Like BoNT/B, BoNT/D, BoNT/F, and BoNT/G, synaptobrevin/VAMP2 is the substrate of TeNT.

VFG002297	VF0375	BoNT	Botulinum neurotoxin	Clostridium botulinum	BoNTs are the most toxic proteins known.; Seven immunologically distinct forms of BoNT exist, designated as serotypes A to G.; BoNTs associate with non-toxic clostridial proteins to form large, stable complexes that exist in cultures known as progenitor toxins. These progenitor toxins comprise three different forms: 12S (C 300 kDa), 16S (C 500 kDa), and 19S (C 900 kDa), and consist of neurotoxin subunits coupled with one or more non-toxic components known as neurotoxin associated proteins (NAPs). NAPs possess hemagglutinin activity (HA) protect the neurotoxin from harsh environment inside host like lowpH and proteases, and include HA-17, HA-22, HA-33, and HA-55.	BoNT is initially synthesized as a 150 kDa single-chain protein that is post-translationally nicked to form a dichain structure. The nicked neurotoxin consists of a 100 kDa heavy chain and a 50 kDa light chain (Zinc metalloprotease) linked by a disulfide bridge. The crystal structure of BoNT indicates that the heavy chain consists of a receptor binding domain (HC) and a translocation domain (HN), while the light chain contains a catalytic domain (LC).; PDB code: 3BTA, 1EPW	BoNTs are metalloproteinases that enter peripheral cholinergic nerve terminals, where they cleave one or two of the three core proteins of the neuroexocytosis apparatus and elicit persistent but reversible inhibition of neurotransmitter release.; BoNT also serves as a remarkably effective treatment for involuntary muscle disorders such as blepharospasm, strabismus, hemifacial spasm, certain types of spasticity in children, and other ailments.	The BoNT mechanism of action consists of four sequential steps:; I. rapid and specific binding to the cholinergic nerve terminal membrane; II. internalization inside a vesicle endowed with an ATPase proton pump;  III. membrane translocation triggered by acidification of the vesicular lumen, which causes a structural rearrangement with membrane insertion of the toxin and translocation of the L-chain into the cytosol;  IV. expression of the L-chain proteolytic activity against specific substrates.; Receptors for BoNTs are composed of both gangliosides that bind toxins with low affinity and protein receptors that form high-affinity complexes with toxins. Synaptotagmins I and II, two homologous synaptic vesicle proteins, have been shown to function in conjunction with gangliosides to mediate entry of BoNT/B into cells. Low-affinity interactions between BoNT/A and gangliosides have also been reported. Recent studies have indicated that the synaptic vesicle protein SV2 acts as the protein receptor for BoNT/A.; BoNT light chains were identified as having zinc-dependent protease activity and to specifically target a group of proteins known as SNAREs.;The L-chains of the seven BoNTs are remarkably specific proteases:;  BoNT/B, /D, /F and /G cleave only synaptic vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) at single sites, which results in VAMP losing most of its cytosolic domain.; BoNT/A and /E cleave only 25 kDa synaptosomal-associated protein (SNAP-25) at single individual sites within its C-teminus.;  BoNT/C cleaves both SNAP-25 and syntaxin.

VFG002300	VF0386	alpha-toxin (novyi)	-	Clostridium novyi	Belongs to the family of large clostridial cytotoxins which act on cells through the modification of small GTP-binding proteins. The family includes toxin A and B from C. difficile, the hemorrhagic and lethal toxin from C. sordellii, and the <alpha>-toxin from C. novyi.; Unlike C. difficile toxins A and B and the variant toxin B recruit the nucleotide sugar UDP-glucose as cosubstrate, <alpha>-toxin uses UDP-GlcNAc as a cosubstrate. <alpha>-Toxin also utilizes UDP-glucose, but the Km is about 340 uM compared to 17 uM for UDP-glucNAc.	-	Like  C. difficile toxins A and B, the Clostridium sordellii hemorrhagic toxin, and the <alpha>-toxin from C. novyi selectively glucosylate Rho subfamily GTPases but not GTPases from other subfamilies. <alpha>-toxins modify the highly conserved threonine 37 residue in RhoA (Thr35 of Rac or Cdc42) located in the switch 1 region of these GTPases. Mono-O glucosylation of this threonine residue has important functional consequences. First, it inhibits activation of Rho proteins by GEFs. Second, glucosylation of Rho proteins increases membrane binding. Third, it inhibits the interaction of GTPases with their effectors. Therefore, glucosylation of Rho GTPases block Rho-dependent signaling pathways.	-	Toxin; Intracellular toxin; Glucosyltransferase

Then DT is taken into the host cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis. It reaches the cytoplasm by penetrating through the membrane in the early endosome. The catalytic fragment of DT is released into the cytoplasm and catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of eEF2, resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis; DT toxin catalyzes the transfer of ADP-ribose from NAD+ to the N3 atom of the diphthamide imidazole ring in eEF2 and has evolved a specific mechanism for inactivating the eukaryotic protein synthetic machinery without affecting the couterpart elongation factor G that is present in the bacterial pathogens that produce the offending toxins;DT has shown intrinsic nuclease activity by degrading double-stranded DNA without apparent specificity for nucleotide sequence	Toxin; Intracellular toxin; ADP-ribosyltransferase; A-B type

VFG000279	VF0058	VacA	Vacuolating cytotoxin A	Helicobacter pylori	VacA expression is determind by variation in the signal sequence (s1a, s1b, s1c, s2) and mid-region (</i>m1, m2</i>) of the vacA gene. s1-type signalling-sequence allele produce functional VacA toxin, whereas s2-type produce VacA with little cytotoxic activity. And s1/m1 strains are more toxic than s1/m2 strains	Proteolytic cleavage of the VacA protoxin (140 kDa) at its N and C termini yields a 33-aa signal sequence, a mature 90-kDa secreted protein, and a C-terminal fragment that remains localized in the bacterial cell; the secreted protein is structured in two distinct parts. First, amino-terminal 37-kDa region,  rich in <beta>-pleated sheets. This region begins with a 32-residue hydrophobic segment with a propensity to insert into membranes, and ends with a protease-sensitive segement. Second, the following 58-kDa part is predicted to consist of two domains, separated by a flexible segment of variable length: the first domain is highly conserved, whereas the second one is genetically considerably diverse.	-	The secreted VacA toxin oligomerized into resettes. It binds to the apical portion of epithelial cells and inserts into the plasma membrane, forming a hexameric anion-selective channel of low conductance. These channels are release bicarbonate and organic anions from the cell cytosol to support bacterial growth. The toxin channels are slowly endocyosed and eventually reach late endosomal compartment, increasing their permeability to anions with enhancements of the electrogenic vacular ATPase(vATPase)proton pump. In the presence of weak bases, including the ammonia generated by the Helicobacter pylori urease, osmotically active acidotropic ions will accumulate in the endosomes. This leads to water influx and vesicle swelling, and essential step in vacuole formation. By an as-yet-unidentified mechanism, the VacA toxin alters tight junctions and increases the paracellular route of permeability providing iron, nickel and other nutrients, this TER(trans-epithelial resistance) effect of VacA could be mediated through specific interaction with the recently identified cytosolic protein VIP54.; VacA is the first bacterial virulence factor that exploits the important plasma membrane sphingolipid, sphingomyelin (SM), as a cellular receptor.

VFG000306	VF0059	CagA	Cytotoxin-associated antigen	Helicobacter pylori	-	Characterized by amino acid sequence polymorphism, primarily depending on the duplicaiton of various numbers of a 34-amino-acid sequence located at the C-terminal region of the protein;Glu-Pro-Ile-Tyr-Ala(EPIYA) motifs present in the C-terminal half of CagA is the tyrosine phosphorylation site.	-	CagA injected by type IV secretion system into gastric epithelial cells and subsequently undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation by Src family kinase. The phosphorylated CagA specifically binds SHP-2 (Src homology 2 domain containing protein) phosphatase, activates the phosphatase activity, which, in turn might be responsible for dephosphorylation of several cellular proteins; CagA interacts with hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) receptor, c-MET. This interaction leads to deregulation of the motogenic response; Non-phosphorylated CagA binds directly to Grb2 by its EPIYA motifs, and this interaction activates the stress-kinase pathway, resulting in the scatter phenotype; Non-phosphorylated CagA associates with the epithelial tight-junction scaffolding protein, ZO-1, and the transmembrane protein junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) to induce the formation of an aberrant apical junction protein complex, which results in the loss of cell polarity, proliferation and differentiation.;CagA specifically interacts with PAR1 (partitioning-defective 1)/MARK (microtubule affinity-regulating kinase) kinase to disorganize gastric mucosal architecture underlying tissue damage and inflammation in vivo. Because normal epithelial architecture constrains cell proliferation, its disorganization by CagA may liberate cells from growth-inhibitory cues and thereby promote gastric carcinogenesis in conjunction with the phosphorylation dependent CagA activities.; H. pylori disrupts the polarity of epithelial cells to use the apical cell surface as a replicative niche. CagA's ability to disrupt host cell polarity is a key fator in enabling colonization of the apical cell surface by H. pylori.	Type IV secretory protein

The activated HP-NAP receptor also stimulates a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase(PI3K) activity. The rise in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and the activity of PI3K leads to the activation of renaturable kinases that phosphorylated the cytosolic subunits of the NADPH oxidase of phagocytes, causing their migration to the plasam membrane. Together with the Rac-1 and Rac-2 GTPases, they activate the oxidase activity with production of superoxide anions and reactive oxygen intermediates(RIOs).	Proinflammatory effect

VFG001143	VF0266	OipA	Outer inflammatory protein	Helicobacter pylori	H. pylor-related gastritis is characterized by mucosal infiltration with neutrophils and mononuclear cells. The migration and activation of these cells is thought to be ralted to the local production of various proinflammatory cytokines, especially IL-8. The presence of a functional cag PAI is associated with increased IL-8 production. But it is not the sole H. pylori factor able to promote IL-8 secretion; regulated by slipped-strand repair mechanism (CT dinucleotide repeats in oipA gene)	-	Involved in IL-8 production	Recent research indicates that OipA and the cag PAI are both necessary for full activation of the IL-8 promoter but act via different pathways that diverge upstream of IRF-1 where only OipA is involved in the STAT1-IRF1-ISRE pathway. The mucosal inflammatory response to H. pylori infection is complex and involves different pathways converging on the IL-8 promoter	Proinflammatory effect

Majority of the dot/icm genes are predicted to encode membrane-associated proteins;DotA is an integral cytoplasmic membrane protein with 8 membrane-spanning domians; IcmK and IcmB proteins are on bacterial surface; IcmQ, IcmS, IcmR, IcmW located in the bacterial cytoplasm;IcmS, IcmW, IvgA are chaperons;  IcmX are periplasmic protein; RalF structure: 1XSZ	Allows survival and growth in macrophages, prevent phagosome acifidication and lysosome fusion, essential for induction of apoptosis in human macrophages	Assemble and activate a type IV secretion system in the bacterial membrane that exports plasmid and virulence factors to inhibit the phago-lysosome fusion and reprogram the Legionella-bearing vacuole; IcmS was shown to bind members of the SidE family (SidE, SdeA, SdeB, SdeC) and to be required for the export of SdeA; IcmW interacted with and was required for the translocation of additional Dot/Icm substrates, including SidG, SidH, WipA and WipB; LvgA directly interacts with IcmS; Dot/Icm secretion substrates have been identified:; DotA, a protein that was originally reported to assemble as a polytopic protein in the inner membrane of L. pneumophila cells. It may form a pore in the eukaryotic membrane for the passage of other effectors; LidA (low viability in the presence of dot), a protein translocated to the phagosome membrane. It regulates Dot/Icm assembly and is thought to be one of the first translocated substrates. It is postulated to function in vesicle recruitment during the biogenesis of the replication vacuole; RalF, an exchange factor for the ADP ribosylation factor  protein (ARF) family of GTPases. It is required for the localization of ARF on phagosomes containing L. pneumophila. ARF is important for biogenesis of the replicative organelle; DrrA (defect in Rab1 recruitment A, also known as SidM), is a multifunction enzyme with both GDF (GDI-displacemnet factor, GDI: guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor) and GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) activites. DrrA has the intrinsic ability to bind to the cytosolic surface of the plasma membrane. Because the L. pneumophila-containing vacuole (LCV is) initially a plasma-membrane-derived organelle, translocated DrrA protein associates with the immature LCV formed on bacterial internalization. The GDF activity of DrrA promotes the sampling of cytosolic Rab proteins associated with Rab GDI. When Rab1-Rab-GDI complexes are sampled, the removal of Rab GDI permits the GEF domain in DrrA to activate Rab1, leading to the stable association of Rab1 with the LCV membrane. Active Rab1 facilitates organization of the LCV membrane to promote the delivery and fusion of ER-derived vesicles. DrrA cycles off because the composition of the vacuole membrane changes.; LepB is a Rab1-specific GAP (GTPase-activating proteins). The LepB protein accumulates on the LCV membrane and the GAP activity facilitates the removal of Rab1 by stimulating GTP hydrolysis. The removal of Rab1 coincides with fusion of the LCV with the host ER and replication of L. pneumophila in a vacuole containing ER proteins.; Other candidate effector proteins including SidA-G (substrate of Dot/Icm transporter), Vips (VPS(vacuole protein sorting) inhibitor proteins, VipA, VipD, VipE, VipF), SdeA-D, YlfAB (yeast lethal factor A and B), their real function are unknown; Once the vacuole provides conditions for the bacteria to grow, functional genes of the dot/icm family become dispensable	Secretion system; Type IV secretion system

The activation of membrane-associated NADPH oxidase leads to production of superoxide anions (O2-), which in the presence of superoxide dismutase are converted into H2O2. The fusion of lysosomal vesicles with the plasma and phagosomal membranes causes a release of myeloperoxidase (MPO), an enzyme that in the presence of H2O2 produces hypochlorite which exhibits a highly toxic potential toward pathogens.Porin prevents the vesicle fusion by insertion into the phagosomal membrane, so MPO discharges into the extracellular milieu, eventually depleting the entire secondary granula from the cell so that the bacteria can safely accommodate within the phagosome.

(S)-3-hydroxytridecan-4-one	CqsS receptor responds to the molecule CAI-1. Information from  CAI-1 is transduced through the LuxO protein to control the levels of the master transcription factor HapR. At low cell density, in the absence of autoinducers, HapR is not produced, so virulence factors are expressed and biofilms are formed. At high cell density, in the presence of autoinducers, LuxO is inactivated, HapR is produced, and it represses genes for virulence factor production and biofilm formation. These events are proposed to allow V. cholerae to leave the host, re-enter the environment in large numbers and initiate a new cycle of infection.	-	Regulation; Quorum sensing system

VFG038892	VF0481	Aerolysin	-	Aeromonas hydrophila	-	"PDB code: 1PRE;Aerolysin is produced as an inactive precursor, proaerolysin, which contains a C-terminal peptide (CTP) required for folding into its soluble form; 
Proteolysis in the loop that connects the CTP to the main body allows aerolysin to oligomerize in a heptameric ring-like complex that inserts into the target membrane to form the pore. Proaerolysin is an L-shaped molecule; domain 1, involved in binding N-linked oligosaccharides; domain 2, involved in binding the glycan core of the glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored aerolysin receptors; domain 3, involved in oligomerization; domain 4, contains the CTP"	Responsible for the hemolytic, cytotoxic, and enterotoxic activities	Secreted proaerolysin monomer binds to raft-associated GPI anchors on the apical membrane and oligomerizes into a heptameric <beta>-barrel pore. Pore formation leads to active chloride secretion and potassium efflux. aerolysin pore is permeable to calcium.  [Ca2+] increasing leads to MLCK activation, which triggers myosin light-chain phosphorylation and actomyosin constriction. The subsequent tight junction (TJ) redistribution causes a leak flux. After cytoskeleton  rearrangement, purse-string formation is inhibited, resulting in defective wound closure	Toxin; Pore-forming toxin; <beta>-pore forming toxin

VFG041907	VF0409	T3SS2	Type III secretion system	Vibrio parahaemolyticus	Chomosome II encoded; similar to the Inv-Mxi-Spa secretion system in Salmonella and Shigella	-	T3SS2 is associated with enterotoxicity	VopT is a ADP-ribosyltransferase effector protein secreted via the T3SS2,  VopT ADP-ribosylates Ras both in vivo and in vitro. VopT shows approximately 45% and 44% identity with the ADP-ribosyltransferase (ADPRT) domain of ExoT and ExoS, respectively, which are two T3SS-secreted effectors of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.;T3SS2 effector VopL encoding three Wiskott-Aldrich homology 2 (WH2) domains that are interspersed with three proline-rich motifs (PRM). VopL mimics a eukaryotic actin-nucleating protein by containing all of the necessary domains to enable it to potently and directly facilitate the assembly of actin. VopL mediated actin assembly occurs in a manner that is independent of any other eukaryotic factor.;VopA effector is a member of a family of type III effectors called YopJ-like proteins that are found in a wide variety of pathogens. YopJ was demonstrated to inhibit the MAPK and NF-<kappa>B signaling pathways by acetylating the critical serine and threonine residues found on the activation loop of MAPKkinases (MKKs), thereby blocking their activation by phosphorylation. VopA and YopJ share ~55% similarity at the amino acid level. VopA is also a acetyltranferase. VopA inhibits MAPK signaling using a novel mechanism. This effector acetylates a conserved lysine located in the catalytic loop of all kinases that plays a critical role in the binding of the <gamma>-phosphate of ATP. Modification of this lysine by acetylation inhibits the binding of ATP, but not ADP, to the MAPK kinase, resulting in an inactivate kinase.	Secretion system; Type III secretion system
